You previously summarised a conversation as follows:
${summary}

New messages have been added:
${new_messages}

Update the summary to include the new information while keeping it concise.
Maintain the same format:
**Topics:** ...
**Summary:** ...
**Status:** ...

Ensure the updated summary reflects both the previous discussion and the new messages.
Disregard assistant meta-dialogue that only asks the user to clarify or restate their request; focus on substantive content contributed by either participant.
Do not interpret or judge topic shifts—capture the evolving set of themes, even if the conversation returns to previous subjects or introduces entirely new ones.
