Conversation:
${conversation}

Focus on the main ideas and keep it concise.
Ignore meta-dialogue where the assistant is asking the user to clarify or restate their request; those interactions should not influence the topics or summary unless the user provides new substantive information in response.
Do not judge or attempt to reconcile shifts between unrelated topics—simply reflect the major themes discussed, even if the conversation jumps between them.
