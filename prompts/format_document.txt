Your goal is to reformat a document to be written with markdown syntax.

The id of the document you need to reformat is:
<document_id>
{doc_id}
</document_id>

Add in headers, bullet points, tables, etc as necessary. Feel free to add in extra text, but don't change the meaning of the report.
Use the 'edit_document' tool to edit the document. After the document has been edited, respond with the final version of the doc. Don't explain your changes.
